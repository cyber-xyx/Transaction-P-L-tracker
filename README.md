# Transaction-P-L-tracker

**Why we did this app**
Most people trade crypto across a number decentralised exchanges on webapps and centralised exchanges on mobile app. 
Creating a consolidated database of all your trades becomes challenging. 
We did this tracker for users to insert their trades and track their overall P&L across the various tokens that they invest in.
